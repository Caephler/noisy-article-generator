# An Image generator for practicing denoising

Currently a WIP.

# Before you Start

Tested on Python 3.6.5. Other versions may not work as expected.

Requires the following Python libraries: `Pillow`, `numpy`, `lorem`, `pathlib`

Install them via `pip` by running the following commands:
```
pip install Pillow
pip install numpy
pip install lorem
pip install pathlib
```

# To start generation

Run `python generate.py`. The full list of arguments can be seen by entering the command `python generate.py -h`
